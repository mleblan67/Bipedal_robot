# BEARR the Bipedal robot
BEARR The Bipedal Electronic Autonomous Radical Robot. Fully self walking robot built by Max Leblang and Elijah Tolten.
# Plan
## Overview/Goals
Our goal for this project is to create a robot that can walk on two legs. It will have two modes that accomplish a different task. We will have to get the robot to balance by itself and take steps by itself. We decided to make ours look like an ATST from Star Wars, and play the Imperial march on a buzzer, which is super cool and impressive, and not at all annoying. We named our robot Bearr for Bipedal Electronic Autonomous Radical Robot.

## Criteria/Constraints
Criteria: Make a two-legged robot that can walk by itself.
Constraints: We can't 3D print all the pieces we would want to, due to the price, and we can only use 6 servos because the Arduino can only support that many, printing large flat pieces
